                    Marlin grew up in suburban Chicago. He received a BA in Sociology from Tulane University in 1990.
                    Upon graduation he relocated to Kyoto, Japan where he worked and studied for two years. Leaving
                    Japan, he and a friend took a three year, 20,000 mile, around the world odyssey on mountain bikes.
                    The trip took him through some of the worldâ€™s highest mountain ranges, across parts of the Gobi
                    desert, and throughout much of Asia, Eastern Europe, the middle-east, and North America.
