                Rev Pam Rumancik is a white, cis-gendered, queer, woman currently serving the
                Unitarian Church of Hinsdale, Il. Coming from working class roots, Pam has run a home
                childcare business, a restaurant in Estes Park, CO, spent a year as a food cart carnie at
                Bluegrass music festivals, and until attending seminary, was a house painter.<br /><br />
                Sheâ€™s passionate about finding ways to communicate across cultural and theological
                divides that honor the essential truth of each person without devolving to the lowest
                common denominator. She believes that we must live our vision of Beloved Community
                in the here and now even as we strive to bring that vision of justice and inclusion to the
                larger world. Pam is the mother of three amazing people, lives with Suki the cat,
                Theodora Parker the wonder-doodle, and her beloved wife, the Rev Karen Mooney.</p>

                Karen is a life-long Unitarian Universalist who learned the art of church from her very
                involved parents She has been educated working and playing, listening and walking
                with people. She loves that UU communities are places where you find people who are
                alive and seeking throughout their lives. She has enjoyed the challenges and rewards of
                working as a chaplain, a congregational minister, a community minister and a corporate
                manager.</p>

                Both Pam and Karen enjoy long road trips, green spaces and time to explore. Pam is a
                writer, poet and new gardener who loves finding things to giggle about on a regular
                basis. Karen is an accomplished singer, songwriter, spiritual director, and the kind of
                person who brings laughter, a lively sense of the ridiculous, and vibrant curiosity with
                her wherever she goes. Together they celebrate both the gifts which abound and the
                opportunities to support others in this perplexing, confounding and joyful experience
                called life.
