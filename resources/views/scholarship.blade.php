                <p>In order to help with camp costs, Scholarships are awarded on a need basis. Applicants fill out YMCA
                    provided forms and the YMCA reviews your application to confirm your financial needs. Based on this
                    assessment the YMCA and MUUSA together provide the grant. Both MUUSA and the YMCA are committed to
                    making the camp available to all and to provide need-based help. There are a limited number of
                    need-based scholarships available on a first‐come basis, eligible for up to 100% of the cost of
                    attending camp.</p>
