                Nic Cable is the called minister of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Columbus, Indiana. A
                lifelong UU from Milwaukee, WI, Nic has served our faith in numerous ways at the congregational,
                regional, and national levels. He graduated summa cum laude both from DePaul University in 2011 and
                Chicago Theological Seminary in 2014. After receiving fellowships from the Interfaith Youth Core and
                the Fund for Theological Education, Nic's passion for interfaith leadership and civic transformation
                became a focus of his ministry. He went on to serve congregations in Michigan and Minnesota, as well
                as serving the Unitarian Universalist Association in major gift fundraising. Nic's family has been
                attending MUUSA for over 20 years. He is grateful to return as theme speaker in 2018.
